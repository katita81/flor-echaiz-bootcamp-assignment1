# Web Page Code Improvement

The code of the html and css files have been modified in order for the elements to fall in a sequential order, 
meet accessibility standards, find semantic HTML elements, see that the elements follow a logical structure
independent of styling and positioning, identify accessible alt attributes and a concise, descriptive title. The
code was also updated to easily view title elements, the structure
of the HTML elements, the image elements as well as the heading attributes.
